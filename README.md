# employeeTracker
Employee Tracker is a CLI program to allow a HR department to manage employees.

Employees are tracked by manager, department and role.  Each employee can be updated as roles, managers and departments change.

Employees, departments and roles can be added and removed as necessary depending on company growth.

A list of all roles as well as a list of each departments overall salary budget can also be generated.

Employee Tracker uses a mysql database to store all data.

Dependencies are:
    Node.js
    Inquirer.js
    mysql npm package
    console.table npm package
